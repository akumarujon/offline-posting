A project I made when I had nothing else to do. I was wasting most of my time surfing through Telegram chats. I wanted delete Telegram, but I couldn't because of my [telegram channel](https://akumarubek.t.me), so I did it.

### About
This project is built with [Deno](https://deno.com) runtime. I used [oak](https://github.com/oak-server/oak) for web part and [GrammY](https://grammy.dev) for Telegram bot part and my [botland](https://github.com/akumarujon/botland) template But it's still in WIP. But you can try it yourself for fun.

### Features
- Creates a bot instance with `Grammy`
- Creates 3 routes for rendering form and sending the post.
- Gets POST request and sends it's data to your Telegram Channel.(for now only in DM.)

### Usage
First, clone this repository:
```bash
https://github.com/akumarujon/offline-posting
```
CD to the directory and run the file `mod.ts`:
```bash
cd offline-posting
deno run -A mod.ts
```

### ToDo
- Add Markdown support.
- Refactor code.
- Support posting on Telegram channel.
